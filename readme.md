Useful stuff

- git switch -c (name) : creates a branch (name) and switces to it.

- don't forget to fetch/push and pull changes.

- fetch is quite important if you are working on the repositories you aren't created

- don't push merge button as you see it. Always check the changes first.

- for now that's it.
